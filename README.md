1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  - When creating a program it is important to think about the end user experience. I try to think about how they expect the program to look and operate when using it.       Do they want a link to open a new tab or do they want it to open up in the same tab? Should it pull up a scroll down web page or would it be a slideshow? User           stories help with this by giving you the neccessary information on how it's expected to look and operate. With these you can make sure that the program is made based     on the end user experience.
  
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  - When I'm developing programs I try to take it one step at a time. If I need to create a login in page I'll break it down into smaller parts, for example I'll have the verification for the login info as a section of it's own then the look of the page will be another. In the future I hope to continue to incorporate this along with other agile processes. I would like to work on a team that keeps in touch daily about what's been accomplished already and what can be done today. 
  
  3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
  - Beibg a good team member means that you're working right along side your teammates and contributing to the overall success of the project. You get your work done along with asking for help when needed and  helping others when necessary. You also communicate with your team about the project.
